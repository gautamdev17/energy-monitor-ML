# âš¡ Smart Energy Monitor with ESP32 + ML

This is a personal project where Iâ€™m building a real-time **Smart Energy Monitor** using the **ESP32**, **current and voltage sensors**, and integrating it with **Machine Learning** to predict electricity bills.  

The goal? Combine **hands-on hardware**, **embedded firmware**, and **local ML inference** into one practical, nerdgasmic system.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time voltage and current sensing  
- Power and energy calculation using **EmonLib**  
- Electricity bill prediction using a trained **ML model**  
- Tkinter-based smart UI (coming soon ðŸ‘€)  
- ESP32-based wireless data transmission and control

## ðŸ§  ML Integration

1. **Model Training**  
   A **linear regression** model is trained on historical monthly data:  
   â†’ total energy consumed (kWh)  
   â†’ median temperature (Â°C)  
   â†’ median humidity (%)

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Input features:  
   - `Month (1â€“12)`  
   - `Median Temp (Â°C)`  
   - `Median Humidity (%)`  
   Output:  
   - `Predicted Power Consumption (kWh)`

3. **Model Deployment**  
   The trained model is saved using `joblib` and integrated into a **Tkinter GUI** for real-time, local predictions.  
   No cloud. No nonsense. Just fast and local.

4. **Smart Prediction UI**  
   The user selects a month â†’ ESP32 sends real-time sensor values â†’ ML model predicts the electricity usage and bill instantly âš¡

## ðŸ¤” Why I Built This

As part of my deep dive into **Embedded Systems**, **IoT**, and **Machine Learning**, I wanted a project that touches every layer â€” from low-level sensing to high-level intelligence.

This is that project.  
**Code meets current. AI meets AC.**
